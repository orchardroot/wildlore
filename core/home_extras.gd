## 3.1 home and garden, the logic (the look is world/home_extras_meshes.gd, the hooks world/home_extras_scene.gd).
##  - souvenirs: one for each of a score of towns, earned by reading any Gazetteer plaque there. Set them on the
##    shelf and the cabinet in Mum's house (slot n is the flag home_souv_<n> = souvenir id).
##  - plaque boards: how many heritage plaques you've read in each nation, as framed boards on the wall.
##  - the garden's bird table, bug hotel and pond: each has one visitor a day, picked by the season. Befriend it for
##    a small gift (and, once it knows you, something special) or try to catch it. Flags: home_visit_<feature> = the
##    day it last came, home_pal_<species> = how many times you've befriended it.
## Everything is a flag with a safe default, so old saves load as an empty shelf and a quiet garden. Pure logic.
